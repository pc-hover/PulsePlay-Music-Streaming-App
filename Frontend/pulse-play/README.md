8. Connecting Backend with frontend

#30 Standard way of storing input text in prop
  value={value}
                onChange={(e)=>{
                    setValue(e.target.value);

 updated TextInput.js with value setValue and signup.js useStates which chnages the entered value as user changes it.       

 - Created  a function in Signup.js for signup which will be called after hitting signup button and at that moment variables {email,username,password ,firstname,lastname} storing the values will be sent to backend and database.
 -Onclick function new thing e.preventDefault (basically prevents the default nature of clicking a buttonthat is submittong form or input )and called signUp function
 -ESLint doesnot allow Commonjs to be above Import{eslint}
 -sending backendurl as object error FIXED
 
#31 Storing the token recieved after creating new user
- this token can be stored in react-cookie package  
- take useCookie has 2 elements cookie,setCookie  in setCookie we set the value of token and give path and expiry date.
- Now register new user devtools->application->cookies we find that new cookie named token stores token returned by backend.
-used useNavigate hook to navigate("/home) after signup
-App.js used ternary operator if token exists then one set of routs else othe set of route


#32

#42 Goal is to make change the thumbnail and track of song in play pause  bar on clicking .
useContext hook in singleSongcard to get access to currentSong and setcurrentSong

UI changes for playPause down bar.

#44 Problem Down play pause is re rendered which causes a new bar for new song 
agar mein new route mein ja rha hu then wo bar bhi uske liye new hai button previous song ka control kho de rha hai 

-useffects is getting called whenever i change the page route eventually calling changeSong function again whuch creates new SAME song and plays it .
-useLayoutEffect is a version of useEffect that fires before the browser repaints the screen.
-useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering
